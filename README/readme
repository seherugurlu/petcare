Project Overview

Components:

Navbar:
Provides site-wide navigation links to Home, Pets, and Appointments pages using Next.js Link for smooth client-side routing.

Footer:
Displays footer content across all pages with copyright info.

Pets
Handles pet input fields and submission (currently integrated inside pets.js).

Appointmens
Manages appointment input fields and submission (currently integrated inside appointments.js).

Calendar
Displays a monthly calendar UI to select dates for appointments.

Routes

/ (Home) — Welcome page with introduction and logo.

/pets — Page to add, display, and delete pets.

/appointments — Page showing a calendar and form to add appointments, plus a list of upcoming appointments.

Dynamic routes (e.g., /pets/[id]) are planned for future development.

State Management

Local state managed using React’s useState hook within each page component.

Pet data state (pets) and pet form inputs (form) are stored and updated inside pets.js.

Appointment data state (appointments) and form inputs are managed inside appointments.js.

State changes immediately reflect in the UI with dynamic adding and deleting functionality.

Structured for easy lifting or Context API integration in upcoming phases.
